Darth Vader is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise.
He is a primary antagonist in the original trilogy, but,
as Anakin Skywalker, is the main protagonist of the
prequel trilogy. Star Wars creator George Lucas has
collectively referred to the first six episodic films
of the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth Vader".

Originally a Jedi prophesied to bring balance to the
Force, Anakin Skywalker is lured to the dark side of
the Force by Palpatine and becomes a Sith Lord. After
fighting a lightsaber battle with his former mentor
Obi-Wan Kenobi in which he is dismembered, Vader is
transformed into a cyborg. He then serves the Galactic
Empire as Darth Vader until he redeems himself by
saving his son, Luke Skywalker, and seemingly killing
Palpatine, sacrificing his own life in the process.
He is also the father of Princess Leia, the secret
husband of Padm√© Amidala, and grandfather of Kylo
Ren, the main villain of the sequel trilogy.

The character has been portrayed by numerous actors.
His cinematic appearances span the first six Star
Wars films, as well as Rogue One, and he is referenced
in both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.
He also appears in television series (most substantially 
The Clone Wars) and numerous iterations of the Star Wars 
Expanded Universe, including video games, novels, and comic books.

Darth Vader has become one of the most iconic villains in 
popular culture, and has been listed among the greatest 
villains and fictional characters ever. The American 
Film Institute listed him as the third greatest movie villain 
in cinema history on 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains, 
behind Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates. His role as a 
tragic hero in the prequel trilogy was met with positive reviews
